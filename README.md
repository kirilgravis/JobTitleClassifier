# JobTitleClassifier - NLP Project
 
 We want to classify job description and predict the job titles.
 
 For this purpose we have used 3 **ML algoriths**:
 * Support Vector Classification
 * Random Forest
 * Stochastic gradient descent

 And also we have used 3 **Deep Learning** approaches:
 * Embedding with pooling
 * Embedding with concatination
 * Transformer
 
 The result and the metrics are shown at the end of the last notebook.
